# Cawood Tennis App - League Expansion Specification

## Overview
Expand the Cawood Tennis App from a single ladder system to support multiple concurrent seasons and external league match tracking, while maintaining the existing internal ladder functionality.

## Key Changes Summary

### 1. Multi-Season Support
- **Current**: Single "active" season at a time
- **New**: Multiple concurrent "live" seasons
- Users can be members of multiple seasons simultaneously
- Season selector allows switching between seasons (view one at a time)
- Each season can have ongoing matches/results entry

### 2. Unified League System
- **Rename**: "Ladder Tab" → "League Tab"
- **Functionality**: Display both ladder-style and league-style competitions
- **Table Structure**: Unified ranking system supporting both formats
- **Ordering**: Position-based, ordered by games won percentage

### 3. External League Match Types
- **Purpose**: Track Cawood club members playing in local external leagues
- **Teams**: Cawood 1sts and 2nds (separate teams, same league view)
- **Opposition**: External clubs (non-members) with basic player tracking
- **Match Structure**: Weekly matches between clubs

## Detailed Requirements

### Database Schema Changes

#### Seasons Table
```sql
-- Add season type and status fields
ALTER TABLE seasons ADD COLUMN season_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ladder' CHECK (season_type IN ('ladder', 'league'));
ALTER TABLE seasons ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'completed', 'archived'));
ALTER TABLE seasons ADD COLUMN league_info JSONB; -- Store league-specific data (division, external league name, etc.)
```

#### New External Players Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE external_players (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    club_name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Stats tracking
    total_rubbers_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_games_won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_games_lost INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

#### Enhanced Match Structure
```sql
-- Add match type and team info
ALTER TABLE match_fixtures ADD COLUMN match_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ladder' CHECK (match_type IN ('ladder', 'league'));
ALTER TABLE match_fixtures ADD COLUMN team VARCHAR(10) CHECK (team IN ('1sts', '2nds'));
ALTER TABLE match_fixtures ADD COLUMN opponent_club VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE match_fixtures ADD COLUMN week_number INTEGER;

-- League match participants (replaces simple pairs)
CREATE TABLE league_match_rubbers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    match_fixture_id UUID REFERENCES match_fixtures(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rubber_number INTEGER, -- 1-9 (3 pairs × 3 rubbers each)
    
    -- Cawood pair
    cawood_player1_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    cawood_player2_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    
    -- Opposition pair  
    opponent_player1_id UUID REFERENCES external_players(id),
    opponent_player2_id UUID REFERENCES external_players(id),
    
    -- Rubber result
    cawood_games_won INTEGER,
    opponent_games_won INTEGER,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    CONSTRAINT valid_rubber_number CHECK (rubber_number BETWEEN 1 AND 9),

### Data Flow Examples

#### League Match Entry Flow
1. Admin selects league season
2. Admin clicks "Enter League Match Results"
3. Form shows:
   - Week number
   - Opponent club name (auto-complete)
   - Team selection (1sts/2nds)
   - 9 rubber result grid
4. For each rubber:
   - Select 2 Cawood players
   - Enter/select 2 opponent players
   - Enter games won for each side (must total 12)
5. Submit saves all rubbers and updates player stats

#### Multi-Season Display Flow
1. User opens app, sees season selector with all active seasons
2. User selects a season (ladder or league type)
3. League tab displays appropriate format:
   - Ladder season: Traditional ranking table
   - League season: Games won % table
4. User switches season, display updates accordingly
5. All other tabs (Profile, Matches, etc.) filter by selected season

### Migration Strategy
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing ladder seasons continue to work unchanged
2. **Data Preservation**: All current season data remains intact
3. **Gradual Rollout**: New features can be enabled per season
4. **Admin Control**: Season type set during creation, cannot be changed later

### Testing Requirements
1. **Multi-Season Testing**: Verify users can be in multiple seasons simultaneously
2. **League Match Testing**: Complete league match entry and stats calculation
3. **External Player Testing**: Create, manage, and track external players
4. **Stats Accuracy**: Verify all calculations are correct for both formats
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure all new components work on mobile/desktop
6. **Data Integrity**: Verify no existing functionality is broken

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Multi-season support, League tab rename, basic league match entry
2. **Medium Priority**: External player management, detailed league stats
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced analytics, enhanced UI polish

## Future Considerations
- Tournament format support
- Inter-club challenge matches
- Historical season archiving
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app optimizations

## KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS ⚠️

### Critical Issues
1. **League Match Data Parsing (FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN)**
   - **Issue**: Automatic import from York Men's Tennis League website
   - **Text Parser**: Fails to correctly extract player names from pasted text
   - **URL Parser**: Blocked by CORS policies, proxy solutions unsuccessful
   - **Impact**: Manual data entry required for all league matches
   - **Status**: Requires server-side parsing solution or API integration
   - **Files Affected**: 
     - `src/utils/leagueMatchParser.js` 
     - `src/utils/leagueURLParser.js`

### Minor Issues
- Various ESLint warnings for unused imports (cosmetic)
- Some development console logging still present
- CORS proxy reliability issues for external website parsing

## OVERALL PROJECT STATUS: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

### What Works Perfectly
- ✅ Multi-season management (multiple active seasons)
- ✅ League vs Ladder season distinction
- ✅ 9-rubber league match entry (manual input)
- ✅ External player management (full CRUD)
- ✅ Season-specific statistics and rankings
- ✅ Admin interface with all league tools
- ✅ Unified League Tab supporting both formats
- ✅ Season creation while other seasons are active

### What Needs Future Work
- 🚨 **Priority 1**: Fix league match data parsing (server-side solution needed)
- 📋 **Priority 2**: Clean up ESLint warnings and unused code
- 🎯 **Priority 3**: Enhanced league statistics and reporting

## HANDOVER NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS

### Understanding the Implementation
1. **Multi-Season Architecture**: The app now supports multiple concurrent "active" seasons
2. **Season Types**: Each season is either "ladder" (internal) or "league" (external matches)
3. **League Matches**: 9-rubber structure (3 pairs × 3 rubbers) with external player tracking
4. **Database Design**: Comprehensive schema supporting both formats with shared components

### Key Entry Points
- **Admin Interface**: `src/components/Admin/AdminTab.js` - All league management tools
- **League Match Entry**: Manual entry works perfectly, parsing is broken
- **External Players**: Full management interface functional
- **Season Management**: Create ladder/league seasons independently

### If Fixing the Parser
- Consider server-side solution (Node.js/Python backend)
- Or direct API integration with York Men's Tennis League
- Current client-side approach is fundamentally limited by browser CORS policies

---

**FINAL STATUS**: League expansion fully implemented and deployed. All core functionality working perfectly. Only the automated data import feature requires additional work. The tennis ladder app has been successfully transformed into a comprehensive multi-season league management system.
