Tennis Ladder Players Guide
Welcome to the Tennis Ladder! This guide covers everything you need to know about our ranking system, match scheduling, and how to compete for prizes.
How Rankings Work
Your Position on the Ladder
Your ladder position is based on your win percentage - simply the number of games you've won divided by your total games played.
ELO Rating
We also use an ELO rating system to:
Schedule fair matches between players of similar skill levels
Track your improvement over time
Ensure competitive, enjoyable games
How ELO works: Beat a higher-rated player and your rating jumps up significantly. Beat a lower-rated player and it rises slightly. The reverse happens when you lose.
Minimum Games Requirement
You must play at least 3 matches during the season to be eligible for prizes.
Prizes
At the end of each season, we award:
Men's Champion - highest win percentage
Ladies Champion - highest win percentage
Most Improved Player - biggest ELO rating increase during the season
