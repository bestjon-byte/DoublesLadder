-- League Expansion Database Migration
-- This migration adds support for multiple concurrent seasons, external league matches,
-- and external player tracking while maintaining backward compatibility.

-- 1. Add new columns to seasons table for league support
ALTER TABLE seasons 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS season_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ladder' 
    CHECK (season_type IN ('ladder', 'league')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS league_info JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Update the status check constraint to allow multiple active seasons
ALTER TABLE seasons 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS seasons_status_check;

ALTER TABLE seasons 
ADD CONSTRAINT seasons_status_check 
    CHECK (status IN ('upcoming', 'active', 'completed'));

-- 2. Create external_players table for tracking opposition players
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS external_players (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    club_name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Stats tracking
    total_rubbers_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_games_won INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_games_lost INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    
    -- Ensure unique player per club
    UNIQUE(name, club_name)
);

-- 3. Add league match support to match_fixtures
ALTER TABLE match_fixtures 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS match_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'ladder' 
    CHECK (match_type IN ('ladder', 'league')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS team VARCHAR(10) 
    CHECK (team IN ('1sts', '2nds')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS opponent_club VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS week_number INTEGER;

-- 4. Create league_match_rubbers table for detailed league match tracking
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS league_match_rubbers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    match_fixture_id UUID REFERENCES match_fixtures(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    rubber_number INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-9 (3 pairs Ã— 3 rubbers each)
    
    -- Cawood pair
    cawood_player1_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    cawood_player2_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    
    -- Opposition pair  
    opponent_player1_id UUID REFERENCES external_players(id),
    opponent_player2_id UUID REFERENCES external_players(id),
    
    -- Rubber result
    cawood_games_won INTEGER CHECK (cawood_games_won >= 0),
    opponent_games_won INTEGER CHECK (opponent_games_won >= 0),
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Constraints
    CONSTRAINT valid_rubber_number CHECK (rubber_number BETWEEN 1 AND 9),
    CONSTRAINT valid_games_total CHECK (cawood_games_won + opponent_games_won = 12),
    CONSTRAINT unique_rubber_per_match UNIQUE(match_fixture_id, rubber_number)
);

-- 5. Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_external_players_club ON external_players(club_name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_external_players_name ON external_players(name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_match_fixtures_type ON match_fixtures(match_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_match_fixtures_team ON match_fixtures(team);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_league_rubbers_fixture ON league_match_rubbers(match_fixture_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_league_rubbers_cawood_players ON league_match_rubbers(cawood_player1_id, cawood_player2_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_seasons_type_status ON seasons(season_type, status);

-- 6. Create trigger to update external_players stats when rubbers are added/updated
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_external_player_stats()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Handle INSERT and UPDATE
    IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
